#' Lymphoma data set
#' 
#' Gene expression in the three most prevalent adult lymphoid malignancies: B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia (B-CLL), follicular lymphoma (FL), and diffuse large B-cell lym- phoma (DLBCL). Gene expression levels were measured using a specialized cDNA microarray, the Lymphochip, containing genes that are preferentially expressed in lymphoid cells or that are of known immunologic or oncologic importance. This data set contain 80 observations from 3 lymphoma types.
